# Graphing Calculator

The Graphing Calculator is a C++ program that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for plotting mathematical functions and equations. It uses SFML for GUI and interface programming and implements Reversed Polish Notation (RPN) and Shunting Yard algorithms for calculations. The program allows users to zoom in, zoom out, pan up, down, left, and right to explore the graphed functions. It also stores input history and allows users to redraw graphs based on previous inputs.

## Features

- **Graph Plotting:** Plot mathematical functions and equations on a graphical interface.
- **RPN and Shunting Yard Algorithms:** Implement algorithms for efficient calculation of equations.
- **Zoom and Pan:** Zoom in, zoom out, pan up, down, left, and right to change the domain of the graph.
- **Input History:** Store and display input history, allowing users to redraw graphs based on previous inputs.
- **Token Class:** Tokenize equation components and store them in a stack and queue for calculation.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC, Clang).
2. Install the SFML library for C++ (downloadable from https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
3. Compile the program using the appropriate compiler and linking SFML libraries.
4. Run the compiled executable file to launch the Graphing Calculator.

## Usage

1. Launch the Graphing Calculator program.
2. Click i to open the input field.
3. Enter mathematical functions or equations in the input field.
4. Use the provided mouse scroll and arrows keys to zoom in, zoom out, pan, etc.
5. The input history is displayed on the sidebar panel; click on previous inputs to redraw graphs.

## Dependencies

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.).
- SFML library for C++ (SFML 2.5.1 or later recommended).

## Development Environment

- C++ development environment such as Visual Studio Code, Xcode, or JetBrains CLion.
- SFML library integrated for GUI and graphics.
